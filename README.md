# SStolink
SS to Link is a Python script that monitors your clipboard for images, asks for confirmation before uploading (with a "ding" sound and focused window if enabled), and then uploads the image to Gyazo, copying the link to your clipboard. The script runs continuously, ensuring you never miss an opportunity to share your screenshots.
